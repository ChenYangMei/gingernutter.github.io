        "Ginger & Oreo Tea House" is the ultimate destination for you and your four legged friends, a place to relax, enjoy beautiful food and a cup of tea/coffe . We are a small family business established in 2016. The initial vision of the tea house was of a vibrant meeting place for people and dogs. This vision has been more than realised since "Ginger & Oreo Tea House" opened its doors and the popularity of our tea house is testament to the strong bond that exists between people and their dogs. At "Ginger & Oreo Tea House" we offer high quality food and beverages for both humans and dogs. Come and join us today!
